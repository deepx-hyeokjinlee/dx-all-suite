"""Fixtures for the inference E2E triple gate.

``DX_APP_ROOT`` is read at *import* time by ``shared.paths`` -> ``dx_app.core.config``
(which also freezes ``BUILD_DIR`` and ``CATEGORIES``). It therefore has to be set
before anything imports ``dx_app`` — module level here, not inside a fixture.

Because of that import-time freeze this package must run in its OWN pytest
process (``scripts/run_ci.sh`` runs it isolated, exactly like the Playwright
browser suites). Any module already imported with the real root is purged below
so a stray import order cannot silently pin the wrong tree.
