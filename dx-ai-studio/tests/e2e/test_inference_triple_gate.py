"""Inference E2E triple gate — SR-586 / SR-678.

One real browser journey (nav -> pick model -> pick image -> click Run) asserted
on three independent layers, so a regression in any one of them fails the gate:

  1. NETWORK  the POST /api/run response is HTTP 200 and carries no ``error``
  2. RENDER   the annotated result actually paints — ``img.res-img`` is visible
              and has decoded pixels (``naturalWidth > 0``), not a broken <img>
  3. METRICS  the FPS / Latency perf cards show finite, in-range numbers

Two tiers share this body:

  ``e2e_mock``  fixture DX_APP_ROOT + shell fake runner. Deterministic, no NPU,
                seconds. This is the tier that blocks a PR.
  ``e2e_npu``   the real dx-runtime tree and a real ``.dxnn`` on the DX-M1.
                Opt-in (``DX_E2E_NPU_MODEL``), for nightly / the ``run-npu`` label.

Only the NPU binary differs between tiers — the studio server, the perf parser,
the result-image pipeline and the browser assertions are identical, so the mock
tier genuinely exercises the production path rather than a stub of it.
