"""The home runs the agent without leaving the page — on the module's API.

The home gets its own agent surface and dx_agent_dev keeps its own. That is two
UIs, and it must not become two implementations: the launcher already reverse
proxies the module at `/agent/`, so the home calls the same endpoints the module
calls. Nothing about running an agent is reimplemented here.

What is genuinely new is only the rendering. The stream is already typed —
`message` / `command` / `log` / `status` / `session` / `done` / `error` — and it
splits cleanly: prose on the left, terminal on the right.
