# Change Log

Notable changes to the DX-AI-Studio User Manual.

## Unreleased (since v0.1.0)

Changes since the v0.1.0 beta manual. The version number and date are set at release.

**Hub and design**

- New home: a prompt box (*Describe anything. Run it on DX-M1.*) that opens the right tool or
  runs the coding agent in place, tool cards with live facts, a DX-M1 widget, a "Measured on
  DX-M1" card and a DEEPX Developers link bar. It replaces the orbital launcher.
- Light, dark and system themes; one icon set across all modules (no emoji in the UI); real
  variable fonts with one CJK face per language.
- A new intro built from real runs and real DX-M1 footage.
- The NPU monitor float starts folded at the bottom left and remembers your choice.

**Remote access & security**

- Other computers pair once with a 6-digit code shown in the launcher terminal; the
  **Connected browsers** button lists and disconnects them. Module servers listen on the
  board only; no wildcard CORS; Host and Origin checks; compile paths are limited to allowed
  folders.

**Tools**

- DX App: the per-model example layout, **Run Demo** (26 demos on a shared stage), live
  Continuous runs with exact FPS, faster async runs (`DXRT_DYNAMIC_CPU_THREAD`), Model Zoo
  inference that runs each model's own example, and runner errors reported as errors.
- DX Stream: Demo Launcher on the same stage with WebRTC or remote MJPEG playback; Setup as a
  step list; launches work on a board whose Stream contracts validate.
- Model Zoo: nearly 500 models from the internal publish page, with real result images.
- DX Compiler, DX App and DX Stream: Setup shows the next step and why a button is locked.
- SDK Library follows the suite's documentation (190 documents, 6 shelves).
- About 370 DX App strings that were translated but never shown now appear in every language;
  Korean spacing follows Korean orthography; server errors are translated.

## v0.1.0 / 2026-07

- Initial DX-AI-Studio User Manual (studio **v0.1.0**, beta): MkDocs (Material) site
  covering installation & launch, the hub, all eight tools (DX Compiler, DX App,
  DX Stream, DX Model Zoo, DX Benchmark, DX Monitor, DX EdgeGuide, DX Agent Dev), and
  the SDK Library & About views. English, with PDF export.  

!!! note  
    For per-component release notes (runtime, compiler, stream, …), see each
    sub-project's `RELEASE_NOTES.md` in the DEEPX SDK, available in the in-app
    [SDK Library](11_SDK_Library_and_About.md).
